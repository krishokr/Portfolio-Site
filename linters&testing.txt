--Linters--
I used Visual Studio Code and I might be wrong, but people said there are no html linters available. 
I used the built in linter for CSS.


--Cross Browser Testing--

I found that on Safari, my animation doesn't look quite the same as on Chrome; 
instead of drawing the image from a blank canvas, it outlines it.

I used Chrome when developing the site, so everything should work as planned.

IE 11
- Logo is black and misshapen.
- Background gradient is off- it moves from black on the bottom of the screen to green on top (instead of black on left and green on right).
    This isn't great for the animation, which is white.
- Work project is centered. This is good when there's one project, but unsure as to if there are others.
- Animation doesn't animate.

There are no issues with Firefox.
